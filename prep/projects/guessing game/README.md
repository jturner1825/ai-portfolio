# Guessing Game (OOP + TDD Lite)

A tiny number guessing game to demonstrate:
- OOP basics (class, attributes, methods, encapsulation)
- Test-driven development using simple `assert` tests

## Files
- `game.py`: `GuessingGame` class and interactive `play()` (guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__"`).
- `test_game.py`: plain-assert tests (no framework needed).

## Run
```bash
python test_game.py      # run tests
python game.py           # play the game
