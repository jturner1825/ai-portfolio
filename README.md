# ai-portfolio

Portfolio of applied ML/AI work — reinforcement learning, computer vision, and autonomous driving experiments — plus focused **Python practice alongside my Java background**.

## Why this repo

My coursework has been Java-heavy, so I’m deliberately strengthening my **Python** skills here. The repo collects **small, testable exercises** and larger projects to build fluency and good engineering habits (OOP, TDD, reproducibility).

## Quickstart

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/jturner1825/ai-portfolio.git
cd ai-portfolio

# (optional) create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

# install deps if/when requirements.txt appears
# pip install -r requirements.txt
