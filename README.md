# ai-portfolio
 Portfolio of AI and machine learning projects, including reinforcement learning, computer vision, and autonomous driving simulations in CARLA.



## About  
This repository contains a portfolio of AI projects completed for independent study and coursework.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning, from foundational experiments to applied simulation in autonomous driving with CARLA.



## Projects  

### 1. Python Prep Mini-Projects  
Small projects built while refreshing core Python, NumPy, OpenCV, Gymnasium, and PyTorch.  
- Skills: OOP, Data Handling, Neural Networks  
- Status: Work in Progress 

### 2. Lane Following in CARLA (Intro Project)  
A reinforcement learning agent trained to stay within road lanes in the CARLA simulator.  
- Skills: Reinforcement Learning, OpenCV, PyTorch  
- Status: Planned  

### 3. Pedestrian & Obstacle Avoidance (Planned)  
Extending the lane-following agent to detect and avoid pedestrians and obstacles using vision-based AI.  
- Skills: Object Detection, RL, Planning  
- Status: Planned
