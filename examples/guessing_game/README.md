# Guessing Game (OOP + TDD-lite)

A tiny number-guessing game that demonstrates:
- OOP basics (class with state, methods, simple encapsulation)
- TDD-style development using plain `assert` tests

## Files
- `game.py` — `GuessingGame` class and interactive `play()` (guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__"`).
- `test_game.py` — simple `assert` tests (no framework required).

## Run tests
```bash
python test_game.py
